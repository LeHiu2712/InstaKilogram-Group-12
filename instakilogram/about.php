    <p>Name: Le Trung Hieu Student number: s3818683 Background: 1st year at RMIT, Hobbies: researching IT, especially video games technology, playing and working with music. IT interest: I want to be a part of a game developing team as an audio programmer as I am having interests in both video games and music, which make me one to combine them into a career. The first step to make my dream come true is to contribute my best efforts to this project. IT experience: beginner at Python, Java, and C, learned some basic MySQL language from the last course.</p>

<p>Name: Hoang Vu Anh Quan Student number: s3904629 Background: Freshman at RMIT university Hobbies: Investing, Crypto, Blockchain, Video Games. IT interest: I want to do anything that is related to trading and cryptocurrency. My target is to become a millionaire at 26. However, a bachelor&rsquo;s degree is also an important achievement to reach that level, therefore I will try my best to help build and contribute to this project. IT experience: beginner at Python, HTML, CSS, and C, learning some basic MySQL from the current course.</p>

<p>Name: Nguyen Viet Lam Tung Student number: S3891452 Background: 1st year at RMIT Hobbies: playing video games, researching, and watching some short videos about IT technologies.  IT interest: creating a video game that can combine security about the network into a game in order to reduce the interruption of the network while the user is playing and enjoying a game is my target. However, the first step to achieve my dream is to contribute to this project and learn some skills, some special aspects that come from th&iacute; project. IT experience: beginner at Python and Java, learned some basic MySQL language from the previous course.</p>

<p>Name: Tran Chi Toan Student number: S3891637 Background: 1st year at RMIT,  Hobbies: playing video games, watching TV shows and movies. However, if eating is considered a hobby, I would rank it my most favorite. IT interest: creating a video game that makes people can&rsquo;t stop playing and obsess about it is my dream. While programming or dealing with codes sounds frustrating and boring to people (at least my family), it gives me joy especially when problems are solved. This project is about an interactive system that could also get people to obsess with it, so I think this might be the first step. IT experience: beginner at Python and Java, learned some basic MySQL language from the last course.</p>

<p>Group processes:  People are paired by teachers because the group is lacking people at the start, rather than coming together through research. Due to the epidemic and the fact that some members were going through a difficult time, communication was initially difficult. After several meetings, however, everyone has agreed to work on this project together.   If the deadline is extended in the future, we will consider testing the mobile app, improving the UI/UX, adding emojis to comments, adding a clock feature to time cooking, or renaming the app to be more professional.</p>

<p>Career Plans: The majority of the team members are interested in pursuing a future career in technology or programming. Because the majority of the group's young members were born in the late 90s and early 2000s, everyone considers to be video games developers as a part of their childhood; therefore, the story of three members in the group, Chi, Tung, and Hieu, who all want to make a hit game, is understandable. Additionally, Hieu is known to be a very passionate music person, and if he can't join a system development team, he can technically work for music concerts. Quan, on the other hand, took a detour rather than pursue a career in game development, cryptocurrency, or blockchain development, a bold move that few predicted.</p>

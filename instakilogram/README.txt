Name: Tran Chi Toan
Student number: S3891637
Background: 2nd year at RMIT, 
Hobbies: playing video games, watching TV shows and movies. However, if eating is considered a hobby, I would rank it my most favorite.
IT interest: creating a video game that makes people can’t stop playing and obsess about it is my dream. While programming or dealing with codes sounds frustrating and boring to people (at least my family), it gives me joy especially when problems are solved. This project is about an interactive system that could also get people to obsess with it, so I think this might be the first step.
IT experience: beginner at Python and Java, learned some basic MySQL language from the last course.


Instruction:

First, we run the server emulator with Xampp. After opening all of the required modules and moving all of the website's files to the htdocs folder, we open a web browser and type localhost/instakilogram/index.php into the address bar.

If you are a new user and have not agreed to the website's terms about cookies, you will see a gdpr cookie notice (it will disappear if you have approved and will reappear only if you use the website on a new device or web browser).

If you are not logged in, you can only see posts shared with the public. If you want to see posts for users (internal) and use the posting feature, you must have an account. Click the Login button in the upper left corner of the screen if you already have an account. If you have an account, enter your email address and password. If you don't have an account, click the button below that says "Create a new account." Fill in your email, password, and full name on the registration form. Then, upload a picture of your "avatar." If you meet all the requirements, click the "Register" button to send the information. If you want to start over, press "Reset." The password that was entered will be encoded and sent to the account. db.

After logging in, a user can post an image by clicking the "Choose File" button, selecting the image, typing a caption above the image, choosing whether the image should be internal, public, or private, and then clicking the "Post" button. Click on My Account in the top left corner of the screen to go to the user dashboard. Here, you can see the user's full name and email address. Click on the avatar if you want to change it. The button to log out is right below.

There are three elements in the footer: about, privacy, and help. Click to learn more about the group and what the website's rules are.

We still use the old login page to get to the admin dashboard. The admin has a separate email address and password:

admin@gmail.com 
admin123@

After logging in successfully, click on "my account" will take us to the admin dashboard. Here, we can see a list of all the users already on the system and see what information they have. If we want to delete their account, we click on their account and click "Delete Account." Admin can see all of the posts, even the private ones.

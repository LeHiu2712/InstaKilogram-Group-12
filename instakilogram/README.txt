Name: Tran Chi Toan
Student number: S3891637
Background: 2nd year at RMIT, 
Hobbies: playing video games, watching TV shows and movies. However, if eating is considered a hobby, I would rank it my most favorite.
IT interest: creating a video game that makes people can’t stop playing and obsess about it is my dream. While programming or dealing with codes sounds frustrating and boring to people (at least my family), it gives me joy especially when problems are solved. This project is about an interactive system that could also get people to obsess with it, so I think this might be the first step.
IT experience: beginner at Python and Java, learned some basic MySQL language from the last course.
